# Asherah - Authentication

Code is based from scotch.io's Node Authentication

We used the following:
1. PassportJS to authenticate users locally, with Facebook, Twitter, and Google. 
2. Parse as our server.

## Instructions

See the magic by simply going to the dir, and then write "node server.js" on your terminal, visit http://localhost:3000 and then that's it!
